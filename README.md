This project implements real-time recognition and tracking of multiple hand gestures using OpenCV. It leverages computer vision techniques to detect hands, identify gestures, and track movement in a live video feed or pre-recorded videos. The system supports multiple gestures such as thumbs up, open palm, and peace sign, with potential for expanding the gesture set.

Features:

Real-time Hand Detection: Detects multiple hands in a single frame.
Gesture Recognition: Identifies predefined gestures using contour analysis, convex hull, and defects detection.
Multi-Hand Tracking: Simultaneously tracks multiple hands for independent gesture recognition.
Scalability: Gesture set is easily expandable.
Interactive Applications: Suitable for games, sign language interpretation, or controlling devices.
